============

This is an open web app, targetted at Firefox OS and tested initially on the Geeksphone Peak, that displays live data from Smart Citizen Kit sensors.

How to Install
--------------

To install from source:

1. Connect your device via USB to a computer running Firefox and the [Firefox OS Simulator](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/) or [Firefox App Manager](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager)
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. From the Firefox OS Simulator or App Manager, push the app to your device.

How to Configure
----------------

When the app first launches you'll be prompted to enter your Smart Citizen API key, which you can [get for free here](http://smartcitizen.me/). Enter it, tap Save, and data from your sensor should be displayed.

Todo
----

 * Handle situations where there is more than one sensor attached to a Smart Citizen API key (right now only the first sensor's data is returned and displayed)
